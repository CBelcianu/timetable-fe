  <h3>See what is important to you</h3>
  <p>Everyone has different priorities. Some prefer to keep track of their faculty schedule,
    others want to see their personal activities and then there are the ones who want to visualize both.
    By clicking on the Group View option in the panel on the timetable page, you can choose what
    activities are displayed. Moreover, just below the panel, you can also select the week you want to see
    (since our uni works on a span of 2 weeks activities). When you are done, you will see what is important for
    you right now be able to fully focus on it.
  </p>

  <h3>Customize your view</h3>
  <p>Not everyone likes the same kind of pizza nor the same kind of calendar. That's why the
    View settings option in the panel page on the timetable lets you choose the view which is the
    most suited for you.</p>

  <h3>Export your schedule on your device</h3>
  <p>Some will not like our design and we understand that. However we consider that we do a good job
    at generating a fitting schedule for you. So, we offer you the possibility to export it on your
    device as an xlsx file through the third option in the panel on the timetable page.</p>

  <h3>Add activities in your schedule</h3>
  <p>While uni is important, we know that you want to enjoy what you like too.
    So, whenever you see an opening in your schedule on the timetable page and want to add an activity, just do it.
    Double click on the opening, fill in the details and there you are. Your brand new activity is there and we will
    make sure to take it into account if we choose to optimize your schedule.
  </p>


  <h3>Optimize your schedule</h3>
  <p>Planning a schedule can give anyone a really bad headache. That's why we offer to do it for you.
    By clicking on the red button on the timetable page, you will be redirected to the flow of
    generating your very new timetable. We will ask you if you have any preferences (we offer
    the possibility to chose the start and end hour for each day and how many hours worth of activities you want
    for each day in particular). When you are done, let us do our magic.
    We'll show you the changes we made to your last schedule and you can accept or reject them if you like.
    Should you reject them, we have a little advice. Don't classify everything as being of high priority.
    While we treat it as such, we won't be able to generate a befitting schedule for you which will respect
    all your preferences. Should you accept, congrats. Your new schedule is up and ready to be made the best of it</p>

  <h3>Define your profile</h3>
  <p>Whatever we do, we do it for you and we need your input. So whenever something changed and you feel that we
    should take it into consideration, go to your profile page and let us know. Click on your account, choose
    Manage your timetable account and fill us up on what has changed.</p>
